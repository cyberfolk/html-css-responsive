# html-css Responsive

**Initial commit**: 17/02/23

**Tecnologie:** HTML, CSS e @media-query.

**Info**:📱 🖥️ My first approaches with responsive layouts are uploaded to this repository!
In these exercises using media queries and a Mobile First approach, I created a layout capable of adapting to the dimensions of various devices... at the beginning, it seemed complicated, but after doing it I can assure you that there was no magic, that would come later with Bootstrap 😉
